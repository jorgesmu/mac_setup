# Mac setup

## What is Mac setup?
Mac setup is a script for easy setup with my personal preferences on a new mac computer.

If my computer breaks and I need to get a new one, I just want to run the script and get everything setup while I get a coffee in the meantime.

Setups included:

- Python dev env
- Ruby dev env
- Programs
- Terminal enhancements
- Aliases and links

## Usage
1. clone
2. bash setup.py
